## Adding New Quizzes

To add new quizzes for 8th grade:

2. Add a `quizData.js` file with the quiz structure
3. Update `src/data/8th_Grade/index.js` to import the new subject
4. Follow the existing quiz data format for consistency

## Quiz Data Format

Each quiz should follow this structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "unique_id",
  title: "Quiz Title",
  subject: "Subject Name", 
  description: "Quiz description",
  questions: [
    {
      id: "question_id",
      question: "Question text",
      options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
      correctAnswer: 0 // Index of correct option (0-3)
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- All previous 7th grade content remains accessible in the archived folders
- The front-end now exclusively serves 8th grade content
